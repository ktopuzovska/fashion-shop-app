E2E Test Automation with WebdriverIO and TypeScript
This project demonstrates End-to-End (E2E) test automation scripts using WebdriverIO with TypeScript for the following functionalities on the website Automation Practice:

	1. Login Functionality
	2. Search Functionality
	3. Add to Cart Functionality
The tests use the Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability and scalability.

PRERRQUISITES
	Before running the tests, ensure that you have the following installed:

	Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
	npm (Node Package Manager)

INSTALLATION
1. Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name/automation-testing.git
	cd automation-testing

2. Install the required dependencies:
	npm install

3. Install WebdriverIO, Mocha, Typescript, and other required packages:
	npm install --save-dev webdriverio @wdio/mocha-framework @wdio/local-runner @wdio/spec-reporter @wdio/chromedriver-service typescript ts-node

PROJECT STRUCTURE
	The project is structured as follows:


/tests
  ├── pages
  │   ├── HomePage.ts         # Home page object (used for Search and Add to Cart)
  │   ├── ProductPage.ts      # Product page object (used for Add to Cart)
  │   ├── CartPage.ts         # Cart page object (used for Add to Cart)
  │   ├── LoginPage.ts        # Login page object
  │   └── SearchPage.ts       # Search page object
  ├── specs
  │   ├── login.spec.ts       # Login E2E test case
  │   ├── search.spec.ts      # Search E2E test case
  │   ├── addToCart.spec.ts   # Add to Cart E2E test case
  ├── wdio.conf.ts            # WebdriverIO configuration file

RUNNING THE TESTS

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the tests using the following command:
	npx wdio wdio.conf.ts

	This command will run all the tests in the specs folder using Mocha as the test framework.

REPORT GENERATION
	WebdriverIO provides a spec reporter by default. You can also configure additional reporters such as allure, html, etc., by modifying the wdio.conf.ts configuration file.

	To view the results in the terminal, you can check the output generated by Mocha.

	For Allure reports, you can install the Allure reporter and configure it as follows: 
		npm install --save-dev @wdio/allure-reporter

	Then in wdio.conf.ts, add the allure reporter in the reporters section:
		reporters: ['spec', 'allure'],

	After the tests are completed, generate the report using the following command:
		allure generate allure-results --clean
		allure open
